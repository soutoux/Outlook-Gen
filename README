Outlook Account Generator
This is a Node.js script that automates the registration of Outlook accounts using Puppeteer. It generates fictitious user information using the Faker library and creates accounts automatically on the Outlook website.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system.

Installation
Clone this repository to your local environment.

In the project directory, run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

npm install puppeteer puppeteer-extra puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth faker

Ensure you have Google Chrome installed and update the executable path in the code if necessary.

Usage
After installing the dependencies, execute the script using the following command:

node generator.js

The script will open a Chrome window and start automating the account registration on Outlook.

The account details (username and password) will be displayed in the console and also logged in the accounts.json file.

Notes
Make sure to be aware of the Outlook website policies when automating account registrations. Misuse may result in account blocking or other measures.
